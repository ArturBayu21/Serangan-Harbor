# Serangan-Harbor

This is website is not fully builded yet, honestly, i already made the back-end such as the database, admin page, server, bussiness model and logic, but im not confident yet to show it here cuz there are still many bugs that need to be fixed. I made this website fully from scratch by my self and design it to have an eye catching look (at least for me LOL).

I built this website based on the problems I saw at Serangan Harbor. Foreigner who want to dock their boats are always difficult to get access to the harbor. Starting from who to contact (because the port does not yet have an information system), where to dock or park the boat, what services the harbor has, and avoiding fraud that usually happens to foreigner when they come directly to the harbor.
